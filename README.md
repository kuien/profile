# profile

It is a special repo to store useful configures, scripts and tips used in
individual developing environments.

To avoid possible problems, such as privacy concerns (as you may know, 
engineers are lazy, they always forget to mask the IP address etc.),
most files will be encrypted.

Usage
* `git clone` to download encrypted contents
* `load.sh` to convert them into plaint-text
* `upload.sh` to encrypt textual data
* others, operate as a normal repo
